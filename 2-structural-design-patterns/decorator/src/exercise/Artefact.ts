    // the artefacts that are changed but not committed to the repository with a
    // special marker.
    //
    // Similarly, if an artefact is excluded from the project, we may want to
    // make the icon look disabled or semi-transparent.

    // Every time we need to support a new marker, we have to come back and modify
    // this class. Over time, the code in this class gets more and more convoluted
    // with several if statements and additional fields.
